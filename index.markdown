      <a href="https://everydayrails.com/">Everyday Rails</a> is a blog for
      people who need to build stuff with Rails and get on to their next
      project. Sometimes it's still about Ruby and Rails, though these days I
      tend to think and write about broader topics there. I'm trying to post
      here about once a month.
