This book gave me a new appreciation for Cucumber. I probably won't be swapping out existing test suites to use it, but it's driven my thinking about acceptance testing in general, and how to improve tests as meaningful documentation of an application's functionality. Recommended to anyone who's comfortable with RSpec or MiniTest and wants to stretch their thinking.
