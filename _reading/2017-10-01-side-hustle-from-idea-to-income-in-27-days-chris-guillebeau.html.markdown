I noticed this at the library and have been skimming it. I listened to Guillebeau's podcast on the topic for several months, before it seemed to repeat itself. This is a nice follow-up to that, and his earlier book _[The $100 Startup](http://amzn.to/2fHxJQE)_. If you're looking for a step-by-step action plan to try a "hustle" (still hate that word) of your own, this is a good place to start.
