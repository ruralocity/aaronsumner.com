I saw this on a list of recommended alternative to _Clean Code_. While this
one comes off a little bit academic at times, I appreciate that it treats
the reader like a grown-up and the profession of software development, like,
you know, professional. I found myself agreeing with a lot of it, rethinking
my stance on some of my opinions (the role documentation, particularly as
code gets more domain-specific), and flat-out disagreeing with a couple of
Ousterhout's assertions. My experience with test-driven development has been
vastly different than the process he describes and dismisses. I'd love to
see a future version of this book with more examples in other languages.
