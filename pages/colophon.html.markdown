I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to manage all content on this site. It's not hip, but it's simple and does the job.

Same with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for CSS. I like it because it takes care of most of the hassle of making CSS look nice enough in any browser, so I can worry about the other details.

[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) is a huge, free collection of vector-based icons. The social media icons on this site come from the collection.

The font used for the site is Source Sans Pro by [Paul D. Hunt](https://plus.google.com/108888178732927400671/about), via [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts).
