title: The Project a Month Project

In December of 2012, [I announced my Project a Month Project](/2012/12/project-a-month-project/) as a way to chip away at a nagging *want-to-do* list and maybe pick up a new skill or two in the process. Each month's project concludes with a show-and-tell post here. When applicable, I'm also sharing the source on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/ruralocity). Here's what I've worked on so far:

#### Sound Refound (November 2012)

A Rails 3.2-plus-Twitter Bootstrap overhaul of an old gallery site I'd created. ([Sound Refound](http://soundrefound.com/), [summary](/posts/2012/12/sound-refound-redux.html), [source](https://github.com/ruralocity/soundrefound))

#### Docent (December 2012)

My first published gem; a Rails mountable engine to add a *contextual help* system to a Rails application. Mostly a proof-of-concept and excuse to experiment with mountable engines. ([Docent](http://rubygems.org/gems/docent),
[Summary](/posts/2012/12/docent-gem.html),

#### Leanpub sales data visualizer (January 2013)

A spartan, personal utility application to create charts of sales data for my book, *[Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec)*. Mostly just useful to me. ([Summary](/posts/2013/01/leanpub-sales-visualization.html), [Source](https://github.com/ruralocity/leanpub_analytics))

#### Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec updates (February 2013)

Some much-needed updates to [my book on the RSpec test framework and Rails](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec), covering changes to the landscape that have occurred since last fall. ([Summary](/posts/2013/03/rspec-book-updates-feb-2013.html))

#### Wall cabinet (September 2013)

Going analog and adding a little storage to my barn. ([Summary](/posts/2013/09/wall-cabinet.html))
