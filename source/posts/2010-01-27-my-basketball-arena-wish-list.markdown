I got a lot of hits on my [post about McArthur
Court](http://www.aaronsumner.com/2010/01/mcarthur-court-oregon-ducks/)
a couple of days ago, thanks to it being picked up by an Oregon Ducks
fan site. Like I said, visiting Mac Court was a real treat and I hope to
continue visiting historic basketball courts in the next several years.
It’s occurred to me that one day we might look back at arenas being
built today with the same disdain as we came to look at the cookie
cutter stadia like the Vet, Riverfront, Busch Stadium II, and the
Metrodome. In 25 years or so will we see a revival of retro arena
designs, modeled after the likes of Allen Fieldhouse and Mac Court?

So with that said, I’m hoping to hear from other college basketball fans
to get input on the *must-visit* arenas at which I should catch a game.
Here’s my list—not in any particular order, though precedence will given
to gyms due for replacement:

-   The Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania
-   Hinkle Fieldhouse at Butler University
-   Assembly Hall at Indiana University (due for replacement sooner
    rather than later)
-   Rupp Arena at the University of Kentucky (a replacement in the
    works)
-   Pauley Pavilion at UCLA (scheduled for rehab after this season)
-   Freedom Hall at the University of Louisville
-   Cameron Indoor Stadium at Duke University
-   Williams Arena at the University of Minnesota
-   University Arena (The Pit), University of New Mexico
-   Gallagher-Iba Arena, Oklahoma State University

Keeping in mind that I’ve seen plenty of games at Allen Fieldhouse at
the University of Kansas, where else should I be heading and why?
