Today I hopped a bus with a bunch of KU unclassified staff for this
year's [Wheat State
mini-tour](http://www.unclassifiedsenate.ku.edu/~unsenate/events/minitour.shtml).
Focusing on sustainability efforts in our great state, we visited the
Smoky Hills Wind Farm (pictured) and the [Land
Institute](http://www.landinstitute.org/) (interesting, but not
pictured).

For lunch we grabbed food from Salina's historic [Cozy
Inn](http://www.cozyburger.com/)--White Castle-like sliders at a tiny
restaurant with indoor seating for four.

A few outtakes may be found on my [Flickr
