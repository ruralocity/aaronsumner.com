Just a quick note to let those of you who read this blog know about a
new project I’m about to kick off, called [Everyday
Rails](http://everydayrails.com/). My goal is to provide some insight
and guidance for people who, like me, need to get stuff done with Rails
and don’t have time to wade through the debates that sometimes seem to
take over the Rails community. I’ll explain *my* attempts to

1.  make things,
2.  make them fast, and
3.  hopefully make them as right as possible.

There’s one post up right now; my goal is to get at least one or two new
items up per week moving forward, with a gradual rollout to other
Ruby-minded communities in the days to come.

If you’re interested, behind the scenes I’m using
[Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and
[Blueprint](http://www.blueprintcss.org/) for quick design and
deployment and may tweak over time, but right now I’m digging my
no-image (besides what Disqus may spit out) design.

I’d be interested in hearing what you think, regardless of whether
you’re a Rails developer. I’ve got some edits I’d like to make to the
introductory article and the About page before expanding awareness, so
if you have thoughts on how I can make things more clear please share
them.
