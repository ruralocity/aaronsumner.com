title: "5 of my favorite presentations from Ruby Midwest 2013"
---

I know [Ruby Midwest 2013](http://www.rubymidwest.com/) was a month ago, but now that [Confreaks has all the presentations online](http://www.confreaks.com/events/rmw2013) I thought I'd share a few of my very favorites. I plan to do something similar for Railsconf once those are available. In the order they're listed on Confreaks:

#### [Failure for Fun and Profit!](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2371-rmw2013-failure-for-fun-and-profit)

Note to self: Don't include the word *failure* in a talk's title unless you, yourself, are ready to handle glitches. Kerri Miller did so like a champ. It's hard to present without slides these days. I'm glad to see more developers thinking about *how* we learn, and recognizing that it's cool to not be right all the time.

#### [Rails Application Security in Practice](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2375-rmw2013-rails-application-security-in-practice)

If Bryan Helmkamp's talk on the ways a would-be bad guy can break into your Rails application doesn't scare the shit out of you, I should either congratulate you on a well-secured app or suggest you watch the talk a second time. I love practical talks like this that give you a clear to-do list of things to do.

#### [Functional Principles for OO Development](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2382-rmw2013-functional-principles-for-oo-development)

I'll admit, I need to go back and watch Jessica Kerr's talk another time or twelve to better grasp the content. But that won't be a problem--Jessica's presentation style is a joy to watch and a much-needed respite from some of the dry, monotone deliveries you'll no doubt see at a given conference. I believe Jessica is giving this presentation elsewhere; I recommend checking it out if you see her name on a schedule.

#### [Lightweight Business Intelligence](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2383-rmw2013-lightweight-business-intelligence)

This was probably my favorite technical-leaning talk of the event. Corey Ehmke did a great job of dispelling some of the murkiness of business intelligence, particularly by providing starting points without diving headfirst into NoSQL, Hadoop, and the like. (Hint: Denormalize!)

#### [The Most Important Optimization: Happiness](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2384-rmw2013-the-most-important-optimization-happiness)

I said this much on Twitter just after this session: Ernie Miller's talk on what really matters could have been a keynote. Great message, well-executed delivery. Even if you're not a developer-type, please take the time to watch this talk.
