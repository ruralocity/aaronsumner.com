a part of my ongoing series about [how I work with Ruby on
Rails](/tag/ruby-on-rails/), I'd like to share
with you my top Rails-related feeds. Unfortunately, Ruby on Rails blogs
tend to not always last long. Here are five I find useful--as well as a
podcast anyone serious about getting into RoR development shouldn't
miss.

1.  **[Riding Rails](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/):** The *official*
    Rails blog--important for keeping track of general Rails-related
    news like upcoming releases, conferences, etc.
2.  **[Rails Envy](http://www.railsenvy.com/):** An excellent source for
    news about emerging Rails and Ruby projects such as frameworks,
    engines, and plugins. Yes, I know it's also a podcast, but I have
    trouble focusing on audio-only podcasts, so I just follow the
    text-based RSS feed. It gives me all the relevant notes and links.
3.  **[Ruby Inside](http://www.rubyinside.com/):** Less news, I'd say,
    and more feature-type stories and how-tos. Less Rails-specific than
    the others.
4.  **[Ruby on Rails Plugins](http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins):**
    OK, it's not a blog, but it *is* a useful RSS feed for Agile Web
    Development's directory of Rails plugins.
5.  **[Jim Neath](http://jimneath.org/):** Sporadically updated but
    always useful--Jim's Rails tutorials (and work on projects like
    Bort) are excellent resources for anyone looking to use Rails for
    social networking applications or media sites (or sneaking in some
    social features to an otherwise drab online service).
6.  **[Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/):** Ryan Bates' weekly podcast
    is a highlight of my Monday mornings. Each week, Ryan explains a
    Rails technique. His presentation style should be modeled by anyone
    doing how-to screencasts, and the show notes and associated comments
    are invaluable as after-the-fact references.

There are a few others in my OPML file, but they're either not updated
much or there's so much overlap with other blogs I don't feel the need
to read them both. Unfortunately, for the most part they look to be
abandoned.

I know there are plenty more out there, so speak up--what am I missing?
