needs Safari 4 or Firefox 3.5?Besides Wilt Chamberlain and Paul Rudd, my
alma mater's greatest contribution to the world is probably
[Lynx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)), a text-only web
browser from the days before Flash and AJAX. Believe it or not, I still
use Lynx. It's useful for testing HTTP connections from remote servers,
downloading software onto said remote servers, or just good old retro
web browsing. I'm kind of proud that, with a few exceptions, most of my
current online projects still look pretty good in Lynx.

I've always installed Lynx via MacPorts, but that requires some extra
steps you probably don't want to take if you're just interested in using
the browser. Now, there's a "[termlet](http://habilis.net/termlet/)"
called [Lynxlet](http://habilis.net/lynxlet/) that takes care of the
dirty work--namely, installing Lynx, opening your terminal and typing
"lynx"--for you. Download, drop in your Applications folder (or even
better, your Dock!) and relive 1993.
