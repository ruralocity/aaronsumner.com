title: My issues with Google Wave

So I've had my <a href="http://wave.google.com/">Google Wave</a> account for at least a month now. So far I'm underwhelmed. Part of me thinks it's just me, and that I've reached that point in my life when new technology confuses and frightens me; but the other part of me thinks I'm just the only one who's willing to admit there are a lot of features in this application that are either half-baked or flat-out don't make sense. So here's my list of gripes:

<ol>
<li><strong>Lack of invites.</strong> I got my Wave invite (for which I'm grateful) from a first-round invitee; as a result I get no invitations of my own to hand out. I know the Wave team has their reasons, but this does little to help me <em>use</em> this new tool in my day-to-day life. My contacts list in Wave is cool and all, but they're not the people with whom I need to find a better way to collaborate. Google, if you could give me even <em>two</em> invitations to hand out, I could really put Wave through its paces.</li>
<li><strong>Jumping from account to account.</strong> This is mildly petty, I'll admit--but I have multiple Google accounts. I'm sure I'm not the only one. One's for work (for Analytics usage) and one's for personal/extracurricular use. If I'm logged in with my work account, though, Wave redirects me to a page telling me that I can't use Wave because it's a closed beta or whatever. No option to log out and log back in--I need to go to the Google homepage or some other Google property, log out from there, and then head back to Wave. I was hoping that using Wave through a site-specific browser via <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid</a> would take care of this, but apparently they use the same cookie information.</li>
<li><strong>No notifications.</strong> Sorry, but in this early adoption phase I'm going to go days--or weeks--without new activity on my Wave account, I'm not going to keep a window open at all times. (I don't even keep an e-mail client open more than a few minutes per hour these days.) Google, I know you're trying to replace e-mail here, but it ain't happened yet. I'd like to get some notification via e-mail, Twitter, SMS, or something. If I can add this kind of thing to a web app in a few minutes, by myself, it shouldn't be too tough for Google to add to Wave. Should it?</li>
<li><strong>It's slow.</strong> OK, it's not slow for a web-based, Javascript-enabled application. Hell, maybe it's not that slow at all from a technical standpoint, but watching collaborators' responses in real time borderlines on painful. I want to complete peoples' sentences because I can type so much faster than they can (and I can't type that fast). Google, I know the real-time typing is a cool whiz-bang feature, but is it practical? I read something the other day that this feature was axed from the original iChat-over-Bonjour feature because it drove people nuts. Can we turn it off, or something?</li>
</ol>

I think some of these issues might be overcome by a native (non-web) client. Any word on that?
