love [boxee](http://www.boxee.tv/). I love [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/).
Together, they were totally awesome--my girlfriend and I could watch
shows on an actual TV, not squinting at a laptop screen. Unfortunately,
[Hulu is now being blocked on
boxee](http://blog.boxee.tv/2009/02/18/the-hulu-situation/). Hulu's not
to blame here--it's the content providers (NBC and Fox) who complained.
As many of the blogs covering this situation have noted, boxee didn't
block ads--so my guess is the only reason the providers made this
decision is because boxee isn't something they directly control.

Hopefully we can get a little bit of an uproar about this and convince
the content providers that boxee is providing them a valuable service. I
hate it when consumers get left out in the cold because old ways of
thinking win out.
