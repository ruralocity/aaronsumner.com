People who pay attention to me on Twitter know that I've been working, on and off, on a desk for the past few months. I started using it a few weeks ago, tweaked a couple of things earlier this week, and aside from one final thing am content with calling it done.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockchalk/14190944447" title="Finished desk by Aaron Sumner, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2920/14190944447_9f2c539bca_z.jpg" width="640" height="428" alt="Finished desk"></a>

The desk is made of three parts: The two pedestals, and the top. Very handy for building outside, then assembling inside. I can't claim the design; it's one of the plans that come with a [Kreg jig system](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DYFISG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001DYFISG&linkCode=as2&tag=everrail-20&linkId=QZMRRQOUGFQFU2WC). I didn't make any changes, other than mounting a cable organizer underneath and cutting a hole in the back of the right pedestal to run hard drive cables. (I also plan to find a better power adapter to hide underneath.)

It's got its flaws, and I know where they are. You don't need to point them out. But this was my largest building project to date, and I'm happy with it. In the end I spent about $200 on materials and somewhere between ten and twenty hours on construction. In return, I got a much more solid piece of furniture than I'd get for that amount of money (or more) at an office supply store.

Not bad for a guy who stumbled through a couple of quarters of junior high shop class and avoided the industrial arts for the rest of his scholastic career. (I did have a grandfather who helped me learn the value of doing things yourself, though.)

I find that as I get old, and maybe a litle tired of building the web, that I'm more interested in building little furniture projects (warts and all) than yet another website or Ruby library or something. I also enjoy seeing what others build when they're away from their computers--be it construction, culinary, music, art, whatever.

What have you built lately?
