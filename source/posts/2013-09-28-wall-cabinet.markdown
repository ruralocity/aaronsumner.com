title: "Wall cabinet: September 2013's Project of the Month Project"
---

After a bit of a hiatus, I got back to the Project a Month Project. I spend all day writing code now, so my personal time has gotten more analog. In that spirit, I got out my tools and built this cabinet, now hanging in my barn. See:

I got the plan for the cabinet from [Kreg Tool Company](http://www.kregtool.com/project_plan.html).
