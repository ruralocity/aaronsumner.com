### [Lego City Undercover](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0K3PM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002I0K3PM&linkCode=as2&tag=everrail-20)

I picked up a Wii U last November on a good deal. The bundled Mario game is fine, but truth be told I'm not a huge Mario fan--so I was glad to get something different for my birthday last week. *Lego City Undercover* has been pretty fun so far--think *Grand Theft Auto* but with less blood and, you know, Legos.

### [Veronica Mars](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SULWJA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000SULWJA&linkCode=as2&tag=everrail-20)

So, yeah, I kicked into the now-famous *Veronica Mars* movie Kickstarter campaign. And, like, 63 days from now or so, the movie's going to premiere in theaters and stuff. So now's as good a time as ever to plow through all 64 episodes of the original series. Get started; I have.

### Your local Humane Society

I have six office mates. Five cats and one black lab. Five of those six came from the Lawrence Humane Society. (The other was a stray.) A lot of days they drive me nuts--but as I started writing this, a couple of the little bastards were looking at me all cute-like. Anyway, if you're looking for a pet, please hit your local Humane Society before talking to breeders or whatever. There are some great cats and dogs out there, without any pedigree to speak of, that'll love you for life.
