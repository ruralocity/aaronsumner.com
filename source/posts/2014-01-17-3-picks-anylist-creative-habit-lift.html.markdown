### [AnyList](http://www.anylistapp.com)

I'd been in the market for a service that would let me share lists with others. Not shopping lists. Not to-do lists. *Lists*. I stumbled upon a good one while looking at featured apps in the App Store a few weeks ago. AnyList lets you create a basic list and share it with others. That's about it. Now, it *does* have some shopping-friendly features, like automatically categorizing items into departments at a store. Yeah, it's best for shopping lists, and that's what I'm mostly using it for. But it's really useful.

### [The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743235274/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0743235274&linkCode=as2&tag=everrail-20)

I've been thinking a lot about creativity of late. Specifically, I've been thinking about how habit and routine are so important to creativity. Free up your mind from having to deal with the day-to-day and give it more time to work on more interesting things. *The Creative Habit* might be the textbook for this. I'm about halfway through it right now, and am loving it. Strongly recommended.

### [Lift](https://lift.do)

I'm not recommending Lift as heavily right now, but I am giving it a concerted college try. Continuing with the importance of habits and routines, how do you go about building those habits? Supposedly, if you do something for 21 days straight, you're well on your way to making it habit. And that's why I'm trying Lift. Like I said, this isn't a wholehearted recommendation right now. I have issues with the interface, and I kind of think the folks at Lift Worldwide ultimately have different goals for the service than I have for the app. But if you're interested in tracking your habit-building on your iOS or Android device, it's worth a try.
