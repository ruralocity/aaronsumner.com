title: "Lawrence Rubyists unite? Lawrence Rubyists unite!"

A public service announcement to any Ruby developers in the Lawrence, Kansas area who may not already be members of the [Lawrence Coders](http://www.meetup.com/Lawrence-Coders/) Meetup group: A subset of us with an interest in Ruby are going to start getting together soon for focused meetups, and/or to carpool to the larger [Kansas City Ruby](http://www.meetup.com/kcruby/) meetups once a month.

Interested? Check out the following:

- [Join Lawrence Coders](http://www.meetup.com/Lawrence-Coders/), if you haven't already
- [Fill out this quick survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bHku2qTq9JkDAljZtlqEp-n_xGNBBe0m1cawt170Hrw/viewform) to let us know when, where, and how often you'd be interested in talking about Ruby
- [Join in on the discussion](http://www.meetup.com/Lawrence-Coders/messages/boards/thread/33574092) with other area Rubyists

I'm hoping to really get rolling on this after Railsconf, but no need to wait on that for planning and discussing.
