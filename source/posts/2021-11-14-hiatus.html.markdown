It’s been awhile since I’ve written much; so long that I’ve decided to make it a
formal hiatus.

For the indefinite future, I am taking a break from side projects, including
Everyday Rails, public speaking, and my testing book. I think about software
enough at my day job already, and need to spend some time to focus on health and
personal matters. I am ok, I just have a lot on my plate that’s more important
than software right now.

I’m best reachable via [my contact form]. (Friends who have my number, please
text!) I don’t pay much attention to Twitter or Facebook, so no guarantees
there. I’m still on Instagram, but feel kind of gross about it and need to take
breaks from it, too, from time to time.

Anyway, thank you for your understanding. Be well, and see you on the other side
of this.
