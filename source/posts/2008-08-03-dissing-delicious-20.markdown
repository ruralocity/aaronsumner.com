del.icio.us is dead. Long live Delicious.

Last week, as you may know, the long-awaited update to the social bookmarking site <a href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a> was released to much fanfare and overwhelmingly positive reviews. I've been away at a conference and letting my feeds slide, so aside from glancing at <a href="http://delicious.com/swtchbld">my own list of bookmarks</a>, I hadn't really had a chance to dig into the new-look site until this weekend.

Overall, the updated look-and-feel is nice, I guess. There was something to be said about del.icio.us's somewhat unassuming, old-school look--remember when a site didn't have to have a shiny interface to be useful? Not to say Delicious goes over the top--I don't see any glassy logos or "beta" warnings here--maybe I just miss what I was used to. Oh well.

My big issue with the new-look Delicious has more to do with day-to-day usefulness. First off, if you're a long-time user and have stuck with bookmarklets rather than a plugin or third-party app, you'll want to <a href="http://delicious.com/help/bookmarklets">update them for better use with Delicious</a>. Maybe this was part of my problem--I've probably been using the same save bookmark method for more than a year. The default option now looks like this:

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="/uploads/2008/08/safariscreensnapz002.jpg" alt="SafariScreenSnapz002.jpg" border="0" width="436" height="492" /></div>

Not bad, I know--until you get into tagging. I liked having all my tags on one page as reference for how I might tag a new bookmark. I have a feeling this change was put in place to accommodate those who apply a zillion tags to any given item, as opposed to folks like me who can usually label a bookmark in two to four words.

Sure, those two to four words are probably going to be present under "Recommended" or "Popular"--but what if they're not? Do I just need to break down and bundle all those currently unbundled tags I still have floating around? And why should I have to click a separate tab to share a link in my network? There's a lot of clicking going on to accomplish things that were just right there originally.

If you dig around in Delicious's Help section, you'll come across the <a href="http://delicious.com/help/bookmarklets">Bookmarklets</a> page. This is where I went to update the basic, default bookmarklet. If you scroll to the bottom you'll find the "Save to Delicious (Full-Save)" bookmarklet, which might be better than the basic, but still requires a lot of extra clicking in my opinion:

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="/uploads/2008/08/safariscreensnapz004.jpg" alt="SafariScreenSnapz004.jpg" border="0" width="500" height="559" /></div>

Maybe it's too early for me to start complaining--maybe I'll like it more after a few more days of use.
