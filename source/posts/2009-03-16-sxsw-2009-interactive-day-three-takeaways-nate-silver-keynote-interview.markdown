I'm not a big statistics or measurement nerd, but like many others I became nigh obsessed with <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/">fivethirtyeight.com</a> during last year's presidential campaign. It was a real tread to get to hear <strong>Nate Silver</strong> talk about the impetus behind the site and, in general, his view of things. It's funny how the Internet can make a celebrity out of people who are actually intelligent these days.

Just a few quick takeaways:

<ol>
<li>fivethirtyeight.com was born out of frustration--news channels have a tendency to put their own spin on data, to focus on data that may be poorly conducted, poorly interpreted, or outright skewed. Nate saw a need to distill these data and present them in a plain English style. Takeaway: If you don't like something, or don't like that something doesn't exist, do something about it.</li>
<li>"A poorly-executed objective study is worse than a well-executed subjective one."</li>
</ol>
