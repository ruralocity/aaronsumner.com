I've been away for a week and have let my <a href="http://delicious.com/stratepedia">Delicious activity</a> do my talking both here and on the <a href="http://hello.stratepedia.org/">work blog</a>. I've got 700 photos to root through but here are a few teasers, from a Slice-of-America July 4th parade in Iron Mountain, Michigan.

I really like this one, if I may say so myself.

And I have nightmares about this one. I believe he was advertising an upcoming pig roast. <em>A pig is going to be a chef at a pig roast,</em> how screwed up is that?
