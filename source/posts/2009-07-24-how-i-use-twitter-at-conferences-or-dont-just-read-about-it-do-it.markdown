title: How I use Twitter at conferences (or, don't just read about it; do it)

tags: [ Twitter, "SIDLIT 2009" ]

Kansas City's [SIDLIT](http://www.sidlit.org/) conference is next week,
and conference organizers are promoting Twitter use this year with
numerous links to guides on "how" to use it. I'm not going to forward
these links any further; most of them are academic and show little to no
evidence that the people who wrote them have actually *used* Twitter in
conference environments.

Academics think too much, if you ask me. The best way to figure this out
is to do it. Rather than write a multi-page outline, backed by cited
references and academic jargon, I'm going to distill what you need to do
in as few steps as possible:

![TweetieScreenSnapz001.jpg](/uploads/2009/07/TweetieScreenSnapz0011.jpg)

1.  **[Get a Twitter account](http://twitter.com/)**, if you don't have
    one already. It's free and takes like two minutes to start; four
    minutes to add a photo and fill in a short bio.
2.  **Get a Twitter client with built-in search**. I was using
    [TweetDeck](http://tweetdeck.com/beta/) at SXSW this past
    spring--it's feature-rich and cross-platform (Adobe AIR required).
    I've since moved to the Mac-only client
    [Tweetie](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/) because I like its
    simplicity. You can also use Twitter's web client to search, but I
    like having a standalone app.
3.  **Find out what your conference's hash tag is**. You know those
    words you see in people's posts like *\#sxsw* or *\#followfriday* or
    *\#SIDLIT*? Those are hash tags. Most conferences these days have
    one identified early on--they are key to making Twitter a usable,
    social tool for any event. If your conference doesn't have a hash
    tag identified, take charge and make one. There aren't any rules,
    other than it should start with a \# and be as short as possible, to
    provide more room for your message.
4.  **Add the hash tag to your stored Twitter searches**. In TweetDeck,
    create a new column for the search. In Tweetie you can do this by
    clicking the magnifying glass icon. Again, you can use Twitter's web
    interface if necessary. *Do this before the conference starts* to
    begin to get a feel for who else is using Twitter at the event.
5.  **Start tweeting**. If your post is related to the conference, make
    sure the conference hash tag is included. In spite of what some of
    the academics say, there aren't any strict rules about this. At SXSW
    I used Twitter as a notepad, recording anything I wanted to remember
    at any given talk. Did that annoy people who were following me prior
    to the conference? Perhaps, but I don't care, and neither should
    you--use Twitter for yourself, not for everyone else. Chances are
    you're going to find more people who find what you're saying
    interesting than people you annoy. Now, all that said, if you feel
    more comfortable posting one salient takeaway from each session, or
    each day, go for it.
6.  **Keep up with what others are saying**. This part takes some
    getting used to, especially if you're not used to multitasking, but
    once you get the hang of it you won't see how you got along at a
    conference *without* Twitter. This is one nice thing about
    TweetDeck's multi-column display; you can keep one eye on the
    event's hash tag search and one eye on everything else. With Tweetie
    I'll probably spend most of my time focused on the *\#SIDLIT* search
    results and ignore the rest of my life, catching up on the latter
    during breaks. What might you see? Depending on who else is using
    Twitter, you might be able to get a glimpse at what's being
    discussed at other sessions, or grab a good point from someone
    sitting in the same room as you (hint: retweet it to add it to your
    own stream).
7.  **Decompress, then recapture**. Within 24 hours, take a few minutes
    to review what you posted, and ideally recapture it in some way. For
    SXSW, I [posted blog entries summarizing each
    session](/category/sxsw-2009/), using my
    Twitter activity as notes. As John Medina says in *Brain Rules*,
    "repeat to remember" and "remember to repeat." Even if you feel like
    this isn't necessary for memorization purposes, keep in mind that
    Twitter's built-in memory is fleeting. Your tweets' lifespan is
    relatively limited, so if you have any interest in posterity
    whatsoever, record a backup somewhere.

As for me, I plan on tweeting like heck during SIDLIT, at least when I'm
not presenting. If you're interested, feel free to [follow me at
