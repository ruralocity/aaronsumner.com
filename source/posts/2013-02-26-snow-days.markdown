Last winter was our first in the country. I bought an all-wheel drive to prepare and everything. As it turned out, it wasn't necessary--I think we barely got a foot of snow total by the end of the season.

This year's another story. Well, really, this *past week* is another story. Big snows last week closed my work last Thursday and Friday, then a bigger batch shut it down again today. I went out and snapped a couple of photos to mark the occasion. This was before the wind really picked up and started knocking the snow off of everything.

It's not really a secret that I hate winter, hate snow, hate cold weather--but last Saturday it warmed up quite a bit, so I started rolling up giant snowballs. They became a snow sculpture I called *SnoJo* in *homage* to JoJo the dog.
