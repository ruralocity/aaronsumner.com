As I get back into the swing of things, I figured I'd take a break to share a few more photos with you. These are from <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/publications/pdfs/wildlife/viewingguide/up/22Menominee/index.htm">Piers Gorge</a> in Michigan. A trail winds its way uphill along the Menominee River, past a number of rapids.

Here's a placid area along the way.

No, I'm not one of these rafters. We happened to be looking down at a section of rapids just as two rafts made their way toward them.
