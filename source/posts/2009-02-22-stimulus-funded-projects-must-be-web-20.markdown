afternoon, I read that [projects funded through economic stimulus
dollars will be required to provide information about spending in a
reusable data format](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rssstimulus)--that
is, Atom or RSS. They even provide a specific data structure. I ask my
colleagues--as people who rely on government funding to do our work, do
you think it's reasonable to think that maybe *all* federally-funded
projects, in the future, will require this level of transparency and
data reusability?

I think we need to be ready.

**Update:** I see that
[ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/stimulus_spend_data_coming_via.php)
has some more commentary on this topic. I still think the writing's on
the wall--trying to figure out how to bring this up at work and be taken
seriously.
