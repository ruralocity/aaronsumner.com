An interesting panel of rivals: **Feed Me: Bite-size Info for a Hungry
Internet** featured employees of Microsoft, FriendFeed (and the creator
of Gmail), Yammer, and Microsoft. The crux: Social networks have evolved
from centering around *profiles* and are now about *activity feeds*--the
status messages, photo uploads, and so on--that tell the story about
those profiles. Just a few takeaways to share on this one:

1.  It was interesting to hear Microsoft's take on the issue,
    considering they're coming into social media late in the game.
    Further, they're introducing activity feeds to people who otherwise
    likely have no exposure to social media; namely, Hotmail and MSN
    Messenger users. Later in the talk, though, the panelist (Dare
    Obsanjo) reminded me why Microsoft is playing catchup in the first
    place: When asked by an audience member why these services don't
    just make it easier to use established standards like RSS to follow
    friends' online activities, Obsanjo vehemently came back with,
    essentially, *the market has spoken. RSS may work for you, but you
    aren't the market.* Is Microsoft targeting an increasingly smaller
    audience in its tools?
2.  "RSS as a concept is sound, but the interface has failed." That was
    my understanding of one thing the panel suggested. So, rather than
    fix the interface, we just build something entirely different? Hmmm.
3.  Facebook is to 2009 what Microsoft was to 1999. The other
    panelists'--and audience's--general distaste for what Facebook has
    become was palatable. Sour grapes? Perhaps, but Facebook's
    representatives had better begin girding themselves for even more
    retaliation than they've seen so far.
4.  Twitter was notably absent, but a hot topic. They do two things
    right, according to one panelist: First, they make it clear from
    whom you're receiving content when you choose to follow someone.
    It's opt-in. Second, it's not a mutual agreement--you can follow me,
    but I don't have to follow you in return. Much discussion about
    privacy and Facebook's mutual handshake approach came from this,
    with no real solution I could tell.
5.  Finally, I think they're right about the general importance of
    feeds. The Stratepedia apps need to allow people to follow
    activities and not just settle on browsing/searching content.
