**If your project is for fun, or to learn something new, use whichever technology stack you want. If your project is for any other reason--a customer, client, cause, family member, or friend, then be boring and go with what you know.**

Maybe you already knew this. It isn't an original concept. You can search for boring technical stacks yourself, or watch "[Butterfly in Reverse: From SOA to Monolith](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/oscon-2016-video/9781491965153/video247121.html)" by Mark Bates at last year's OSCON (full disclosure: Safari link, so a subscription is required, and this is my employer--but I don't think this talk is available anywhere else online). I've have a conversation about this multiple times in the past few months, though, so it seems worth bringing up again.

Following this line of advice, I formally started a new project last week, using hosted WordPress. I'll be writing more about why I didn't go with a static site generator for this soon, but there's no reason to reinvent any wheels for it.
