Even though Google Analytics tells me I'm the only one interested in it,
I keep tinkering away with my [flyers
collection](http://flyers.ruralocity.com/) website. For the uninitiated,
I've been collecting those throwaway, mass-photocopied handbills
promoting upcoming "concerts" or other events since college. I digitized
them awhile back and have put them online first as static HTML pages,
then with Movable Type, and currently with WordPress.

current version is OK, I guess, but my idea of relying on WordPress'
built-in fields (and half-ass tags implementation) have never quite set
right with me. Deep down I knew I needed a data model designed
specifically for what I'm trying to share. And as of last weekend, I've
begun this project anew. This is going to be my new project to keep me
off the streets and out of the bowling alleys (the former, at least).
The current, WordPress-backed version will stay up in the meantime--but
I've already got a primitive, Ruby on Rails-built application for the
next iteration.

No screen shots yet, but stay tuned. I hope to have some fun with this
and learn some things my normal work projects don't let me do every day.
