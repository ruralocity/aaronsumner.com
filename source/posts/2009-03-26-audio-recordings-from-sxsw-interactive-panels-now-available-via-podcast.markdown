Couldn't make it to this year's SXSW Interactive? Good news: Audio recordings of panels are cropping up at the <a href="http://sxsw.com/taxonomy/term/44">SXSW Interactive 2009 podcasts</a> site. It's nice for me because I'm getting to hear panels I couldn't attend, and getting a refresher on the ones I did. RSS is available, but I can't get it to work in iTunes--works great in NetNewsWire, though.
