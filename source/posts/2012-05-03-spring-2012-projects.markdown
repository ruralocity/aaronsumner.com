I recently wrapped up a way-too-long-running freelance project, which
means I’ve been able to turn my attention back to things of more
personal interest. They are many, because apparently I don’t know how to
sit still.

In no particular order:

-   My **Rails Testing with RSpec book**, as mentioned briefly in
    [Everyday
    Rails](http://everydayrails.com/2012/04/24/testing-series-rspec-requests.html)
    (my blog on practical problem solving in Ruby on Rails, for those
    not in the know). I’m using [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com/) to
    self-publish it—and, in the spirit of the Lean Startup, you’ll be
    able to purchase my *minimum viable product* for a cool nine bucks
    starting very, very soon. I just need to settle on a cover and press
    the publish button. A few of the chapters come from the RSpec series
    I did in Everyday Rails, so you can get a taste ahead of time.
-   A **second book**, but I’m not ready to spill the beans on it yet
    other than to say I’m working on it with fellow
    [Stratepedian](http://stratepedia.org/) Amber Nutt and it will be
    for a more general audience than the RSpec book is.
-   A cool **Lawrence history project of sorts** that I’ve been looking
    forward to actually starting since the beginning of the year, along
    with a couple of other guys in town. Part of me is disappointed I
    haven’t gotten it started sooner, but another part is glad that I’ve
    had a few months to reflect on it and change my thinking a bit. I’m
    even thinking that it&mdash;gasp&mdash;might not be in Ruby.
-   Resident photographer and web person for a **Kansas travel blog** I
    started with my wife, called [Kansas Road
    Trips](http://kansasroadtrips.com/) . We just took a trip through
    the southeastern corner of the state last weekend, if you’re
    interested in seeing and reading.
