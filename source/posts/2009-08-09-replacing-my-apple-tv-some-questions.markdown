title: Replacing my Apple TV; some questions

tags: [ "Apple TV" ]
---
I think it's almost time to replace my Apple TV--it's great for streaming audio, and Boxee is a nice touch, but it just doesn't have the horsepower for things like streaming <a href="http://mlb.tv/">live baseball</a> or Netflix. I've long thought I'd replace it with a Mac mini--one of the most underrated Macs <em>ever</em>, in my opinion--but I've got a couple of issues to investigate:

<ul>
<li><strike>Are there any Mac-compatible USB-to-optical audio converters? My receiver tends to work better with optical audio. <strike>I'd like <a href="http://www.cablestogo.com/product.asp?cat_id=3103&sku=22327#">something like this</a> but it doesn't appear to have Mac drivers.</strike> Anybody used the <a href="http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/Transit.html">M-Audio Transit</a> with a Mac?</strike> I just realized I'm overcomplicating this issue; the mini's already got digital audio built-in and I just need to convert it to Toslink.</li>
<li>I'm guessing DVI-to-HDMI has been sorted out, <strike>but I want to do a little homework there as well</strike> and I actually have one of that adapters; it came with my HD video kit I bought awhile back.</li>
<li>Are there any good wireless keyboard/trackpad-type combinations? Or maybe I should just go with VNC, huh?</li>
</ul>

I'm also not ruling out a Boxee/Ubuntu combo, as I figure I could get some refurbished hardware to support that setup for not a whole lot of money.

If anyone happens to read this and has any insights, I'd love to hear them.
