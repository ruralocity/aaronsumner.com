As I've mentioned repeatedly, I'll be presenting at this year's
[SIDLIT](http://www.sidlit.org/) ed tech conference in the Kansas City
area. My topic is an introduction to the merits of web application
frameworks. Here are my slides--note that they cover only part of the
talk; the remainder will be a live demonstration of building a basic web
app using Ruby on Rails.

Frameworks](http://www.slideshare.net/stratepedia/quick-application-development-with-web-frameworks "Quick Application Development with Web Frameworks")

View more [documents](http://www.slideshare.net/) from
[Stratepedia](http://www.slideshare.net/stratepedia).

If you've got experience with web frameworks there won't really be
anything new for you here, but I welcome your feedback. If you want to
know more, but can't make it to my talk, these slides alone probably
won't suffice--but I recommend checking out any of the "build a blog in
15 minutes"-type videos that seem to be out there for just about any
framework you might be interested in.

Hope to see you on Friday!
