"If Duke and Carolina played another 25 years, they might get up to our level." I'm a Jayhawk through and through, but I've always respected the hell out of Norm Stewart. Quin Snyder turned the rivalry into a joke for a few years, and Mike Anderson is just too dang <em>likable</em> to be a Mizzou coach (though he is making the actual <em>games</em> competitive again).
