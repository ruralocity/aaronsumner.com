I don’t like using mice and I don’t like having to remember (too many)
keyboard shortcuts. That’s why I like [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com/), a
newish Mac launcher that’s based more on keywords than shortcuts, and is
just customizable enough that I can make it do what I want without
having to spend way too time tweaking (that’s why I never could buy into
Quicksilver). Thanks to [Nate](http://twitter.com/natebunnyfield) for
showing this to me yesterday.

I like that I can quickly fire up an e-mail message to someone (with or
without an attachment). I like that I can browse the file system
*really* quickly now using tabs and arrow keys. And I like that I can
create custom web searches to quickly pull up results from websites I
hit on a regular basis.

After a little bit of time getting Alfred installed and configured this
evening, here are a few custom searches I’ve added for my own use.

The rundown:

-   KU’s People Search
-   GitHub
-   Netflix
-   Post to Tweetie (from the Alfred documentation; not sure if I’ll use
    it)
-   Flickr Creative Commons
-   Lawrence Marketplace
-   Go to URL (thanks to Jean-Philippe Sirois for [sharing this
    idea](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jyphy/5045650257/))

If you use Alfred and have some custom handy custom searches, please
share. I’d be particularly interested to hear from people using it to
access Ruby and Rails-related references.
