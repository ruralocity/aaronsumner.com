For this year's [Kansas City Developer Conference](http://kcdc.info) I made a
spur-of-the-moment decision to give sketchnoting a try. I'd read through *[The
Sketchnote
Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/The-Sketchnote-Handbook-illustrated-visual/dp/0321857895%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIVZLK2PABGQI2KAQ%26tag%3Deverrail-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0321857895)*
by Mike Rohde earlier in the year, and felt inspired by the blank notebook
included in the conference swag bag. Here are those notes--it was a fun process.
I hope to give it another try in a few weeks at [OSCON](http://oscon.com), and
hope you'll give it a try the next time you attend a conference.
