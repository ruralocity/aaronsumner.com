I finished this a few weeks ago, but just got around to taking a picture of the finished project tonight. This was my second big woodworking project of the year, and my first project for someone else. This bookcase is in Elise's sewing room. I also posted [some photos of the work-in-progress on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockchalk/sets/72157646301680541), if you're interested.

I based the piece on how I built the pedestals for [my desk](http://aaronsumner.com/posts/2014/06/homemade-desk.html), because I like the look of the inset shelf, front frame, and trimmed top. It's my first project (of this size) that required me figuring out measurements and how much materials to buy. I put it on pre-made legs so it wouldn't block the only register in the room.

Like the desk, it's got its idiosyncracies. You need to expect those if you get an Aaron Sumner original.
