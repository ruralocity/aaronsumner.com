This one was a dud, I'm sad to say. During <strong>Designing the Future of the New York Times</strong>, Tom Bodkin and Khoi Vinh showed off their respective work in print and online (again, respectively) and then debated which one was better. The only real takeaways are that:

<ol>
<li>Content should be platform-agnostic: Print, web, e-readers, mobile phones, etc.</li>
<li>"The need for quality journalism has never been higher." (As opposed to citizen journalism.)</li>
<li>They use micro-sites for in-depth stories. This made me think of things we could do with our project-specific sites, to tell meaningful stories to funders as opposed to regurgitating content to them, but with a different theme/template/skin.</li>
</ol>
