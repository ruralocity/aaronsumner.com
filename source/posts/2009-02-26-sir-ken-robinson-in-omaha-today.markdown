It used to be I'd take road trips to Omaha to see Guided by Voices or Bob Mould. Nowadays I drive up there to see <a href="http://www.thekaneko.org/events/kenrobinson/index.html">Sir Ken Robinson</a>, he of possibly the all-time best TED presentation, lecture on his newest book <em>The Element.</em>

Here's his presentation from TED a few years ago. If you're frustrated with what happens in schools--and will continue to happen without <em>real</em> reform--give it a watch. It's about 20 minutes long, give or take, per the TED norms.

To me, this seems like a no-brainer. We don't need rote memorization in an age when any fact in the world can be found in a matter of seconds. We need thinkers and problem-solvers who are wiling to express themselves and take chances--and a solid background in the arts nurtures these traits.
