I brought my camera to the [84th Kansas
Relays](http://kansasrelays.com/) yesterday. Here are a few of the shots
I got.

According to my schedule and EXIF data this was from the men’s 800
meter.

I believe this was the women’s 100 meter Hurdles.

The Para Olympic Men’s 100 meter&mdash;the first time this has been at
the Relays to my recollection, though I did miss last year&mdash;was
neat to see, but the announcer’s insistence that we all stand for these
“very special athletes” bordered on condescending, I thought. I mean,
the winner, Blake Leeper, ran a 100 meter dash in 11.32 seconds.

From the women’s pole vault invitational. This is April Steiner Bennett,
who it turns out was also on *Fear Factor*. I’ve always been fascinated
by the pole vault because it was banned in my conference in high school,
so I didn’t get to see it on a day-to-day basis back when I was involved
in track and field.

Finally, my favorite of the bunch. That’s KU’s Donny Wasinger in
front&mdash;he turned it on at the end to overtake Stanley Kubenei of
Iowa Central in the final corner. The looks on their faces tell the
story.
