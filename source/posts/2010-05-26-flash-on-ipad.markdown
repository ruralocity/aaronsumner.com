title: "One nobody's solution to Flash on the iPad"

Not that anyone asked, or that this is at all timely, but here’s how I
would approach the whole no-Flash-on-the-iPad (or iPhone) thing:

1.  Apple should stick to its guns on the development tool requirements
    for native applications. Aside from what Steve Jobs has said about
    [third party
    layers](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/), as a
    long-time Mac user I take offense to this approach to software
    development. Products like the [Mac version of Word
    6.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#Word_1990_to_1995),
    which tried to paste a vaguely Macintosh interface on top of a
    Windows code base, should serve as a reminder of what can happen
    when developers get lazy and try to reuse code across platforms. To
    throw in a more modern software example, I quit using TweetDeck
    because Air is such a resource hog. (I’m also not crazy about its
    kitchen sink approach to features, which I’ll admit may or may not
    attribute to its resource hogging.) Write once, run anywhere should
    be limited to web-based applications.
2.  Apple needs to enable Flash-formatted content via plugins through
    anything that uses Mobile Safari. I think everyone knows this is
    technically possible; it just doesn’t meet Apple’s standards. My
    solution? Instead of enabling all by default, Apple should invest in
    [ClickToFlash](http://clicktoflash.com/) (or just hire the people
    responsible for it) and port it to the iPad/iPhone/iPod touch
    variants of OS X. I’ve been using ClickToFlash for several months
    now, from the standpoint that I find most Flash-formatted content to
    be obtrusive, and it’s been great in a standard
    Safari-in-Snow-Leopard environment. With some tweaking it could be
    made a seamless part of Mobile Safari (“tap to play”), but this
    would take Apple’s blessing.
3.  Adobe needs to stop being lazy. This doesn’t just apply to Jobs’
    implication that Adobe is being lazy; this goes back to their
    acquisition of Macromedia in general and Flash in particular. Ever
    since that point (the last time they had real competition in the
    field of applications for creative types) Adobe has taken more and
    more shortcuts to deliver new products with minimal enhancements.
    Any given Adobe app’s overall user experience was almost always
    several notches above its Macromedia counterpart; since the merger
    I’ve observed Adobe’s suite slide more and more toward the
    Macromedia end of the quality spectrum (and going back to my bagging
    on write once, run anywhere, Macromedia was very guilty of pushing
    Windows-like software on us Mac users). Now, Adobe has its first
    real challenge since the merger with Macromedia, only this time it’s
    coming from Apple. How about we see some real innovation instead of
    calling this some sort of civil rights issue for developers?
4.  Apple needs a wake-up call. I thought last week’s [slaps at Apple by
    Google’s Vic
    Gundotra](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/21/google-slams-apple-at-goo_n_584622.html)
    were petty at best, but if Steve Jobs and company think Gundotra (or
    Google) is alone in actively pursuing the next *iPhone killer* or
    *iPad killer*, they should think again. Google alone can keep
    throwing engineers at a problem until it’s solved (though, in the
    case of Android, I contend that the problem is they’re not throwing
    enough *designers* at the problem). I am legitimately concerned of
    three things: One, that Apple will take the App Store, approved
    content only model to its desktop operating system; two, that said
    desktop operating system will cease to exist as we know it (and kill
    web development as I know it); and/or three, that Apple’s hubris
    will hurt the Mac platform as much (or more) as it did when an
    inferior Windows operating system took the world. This time around,
    it will be Google. And while I’ve joked that Google is still better
    than Facebook, the fact of the matter is still that *one company* is
    still *one company*, regardless of what the company is. I tried
    switching to Linux for Rails development, and frankly, I think the
    current crop of text editors suck when stacked against TextMate or
    BBEdit, but if a Linux environment is all we’ve got, then I would
    bet the small companies that have done just fine supporting us would
    do just as fine supporting us on a new operating system.

Ranting aside, I think points 1 and 2 have merit as practical things the
people at Apple and Adobe could be doing to resolve this issue.
