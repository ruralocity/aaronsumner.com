Don't forget! I'm presenting at SIDLIT this year. Come see my <a href="http://sidlit.org/sessions/delivering-custom-apps-using-rapid-application-frameworks">presentation on the virtues of web application frameworks</a>. There will be a very basic Ruby on Rails demonstration, though I'm not preaching one framework over any other--Rails is just the framework I use in my professional work.

The registration deadline was last Friday, but if you're already registered and are deciding on your schedule it'd be great to see you. My time slot is Friday, 1:30. I'm hoping to have some slides online ahead of time, in case you're on the fence.
