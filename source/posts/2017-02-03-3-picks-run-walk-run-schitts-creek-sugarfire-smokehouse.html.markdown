A little levity this week--if you missed last week's picks, please [help me support some worthwhile causes](/posts/2017/01/3-picks-aclu-eff-18f.html).

### [Run Walk Run](http://www.jeffgalloway.com/training/run-walk/)

I mentioned here a couple of weeks ago that I've started running again. After a couple of failed attempts at Couch to 5K (or just figuring out something on my own) I've hit a groove with Jeff Galloway's Run Walk Run program. I'm using Galloway's [Easy 5K](http://lolofit.com/apps/easy_5k_with_jeff_galloway) app as my guide, just on my treadmill for now. It's a little cheesy, as is pretty much every fitness app I've ever downloaded, but it's helped keep me motivated. Four weeks down, four weeks to go.

### [Schitt's Creek](http://amzn.to/2jJaodu)

I didn't know this show existed until we stumbled upon it on [Amazon Prime](http://amzn.to/2kXLyf0) a couple of weeks ago. It's a riot, and a good chance to laugh at something that's equal parts stupid and smart.

### [Sugarfire Smokehouse](http://www.sugarfiresmokehouse.com)

I finally had a chance to visit Sugarfire's when I was in St. Louis in January (I went to the St. Charles location, just off of Highway 370). Wonderful brisket and sides (roasted baby potatoes were on the menu that day), and fun sodas from [Excel Bottling](http://excelbottling.com/soda/). Don't tell anybody, but I really liked the horseradish sauce the best. It's going to be tough to not stop there each way when I'm in the area.
