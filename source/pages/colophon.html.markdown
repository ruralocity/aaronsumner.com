I use [the Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) static site generator to manage all content on this site. If you love Ruby and don't need a full-blown CMS (and the baggage that entails) please check it out.

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is a front-end framework you've probably heard of if you do web development of any kind. I like it because it takes care of most of the hassle of making CSS look nice in any browser, so I can worry about the other details.

[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) is a huge, free collection of vector-based icons. The social media icons on this site come from the collection.

The font used for the site is Source Sans Pro by [Paul D. Hunt](https://plus.google.com/108888178732927400671/about), via [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts).

My mugshot is courtesy of [DESIGNOJEK](http://designojek.com/)â€”a.k.a. David Gnojek, a Lawrence, Kansas-based graphic designer who does great work in both print and online.
