title: What I'm doing right now
---

This page is inspired by Derek Sivers's [Now Page Movement](http://nownownow.com/about). It's current as of June 18, 2016. If my priorities change, I'll update the page.

- I work full-time as a Software Engineer at [O'Reilly Media](http://www.oreilly.com/). I like it there.
- I do some freelance software development work on the side, under the moniker [Binary BBQ](http://binarybbq.com/). I am not looking for new clients right now.
- I'm weighing several options related to an update or rewrite of my book, *[Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec)*.
- I'm dabbling with a bootstrapped startup idea with my wife.
- I am grilling dinner about once a week, inspired by *[Master of the Grill](http://www.amazon.com/Master-Grill-Foolproof-Ingredients-Fascinating/dp/1940352541%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIVZLK2PABGQI2KAQ%26tag%3Deverrail-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1940352541)* from America's Test Kitchen.
- I'm starting a new woodworking project to replace the old bookshelves in my home office.
- I am threatening to pick up the guitar again after several years of dust-collecting.
- I continue to [read a lot](/pages/reading.html).
- I am *not* doing any pro bono work, mentoring, user group presentations, etc. for awhile. I'm sorry, but these things have been draining me lately, and I need to take a break from them.
