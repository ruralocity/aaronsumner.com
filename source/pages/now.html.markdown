title: What I'm doing right now
---

This page is inspired by Derek Sivers's [Now Page Movement](http://nownownow.com/about). It's current as of October 22, 2016. If my priorities change, I'll update the page.

- I work full-time as a Software Engineer at [O'Reilly Media](http://www.oreilly.com/). I like it there.
- I do some freelance software development work on the side, under the moniker [Binary BBQ](http://binarybbq.com/). I am not looking for new clients right now.
- I'm actively working on a substantial update of my book, *[Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec)*. I'm hoping to have updated content available by January, 2017. This will be a free update for anyone who's already bought the book. Buy now--I'm raising the price when I'm done.
- I'm trying to write more in the [Everyday Rails](http://everydayrails.com)
  blog.
- I continue to [read a lot](/pages/reading.html).
- I'm trying to sleep more, even if it means I don't get as much done
  otherwise.
- I am *not* doing any pro bono work, mentoring, user group presentations, etc. for awhile. I'm sorry, but these things have been draining me lately, and I need to take a break from them.
