title: What I'm doing right now
---

This page is inspired by Derek Sivers's [Now Page Movement](http://nownownow.com/about). It's current as of August 18, 2018. If my priorities change, I'll update the page.

- I work full-time as a Senior Software Engineer at [O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/). I work on the backend to software for managing our conferences like OSCON, Strata, Velocity, and Fluent.
- I have moved to the City of Dreams, also known as [Astoria, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoria,_Oregon).
- I do some freelance software development work on the side, under the moniker [Binary BBQ](https://binarybbq.com/). I'm open to select clients at this time. Ask me about Rails application security audits and upgrading small-to-medium-sized legacy Rails applications.
