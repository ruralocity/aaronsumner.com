title: What I'm doing right now
---

This page is inspired by Derek Sivers's [Now Page Movement](http://nownownow.com/about). It's current as of May 25, 2017. If my priorities change, I'll update the page.

- I work full-time as a Software Engineer at [O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/).
- I do some freelance software development work on the side, under the moniker [Binary BBQ](https://binarybbq.com/). I'm open to the right circumstances of client work.
- I'm actively, but deliberately, working on a substantial update of my book, *[Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec)*. The goal is to have updated content available by June, 2017. This will be a free update for anyone who's already bought the book. It's based on RSpec 3.6 and Rails 5.1.
- I'm interested in giving variations of my recent talk, [The Git Historian](https://speakerdeck.com/ruralocity/the-git-historian), to more audiences. Please give me potential leads!
- I continue to [read a lot](/pages/reading.html). I try to read a bit of a technical book during the day, and a bit of a non-technical book at night.
- I'm running consistently for the first time since maybe high school.
- I'm trying to sleep more, even if it means I don't get as much done
  otherwise. Emphasis on *trying*.
- I am *not* doing any pro bono work, mentoring, etc. for awhile, though I'm interested in working with rural government data at the moment.
