title: What I'm doing right now
---

This page is inspired by Derek Sivers's [Now Page Movement](http://nownownow.com/about). It's current as of November 26, 2017. If my priorities change, I'll update the page.

- I work full-time as a Software Engineer at [O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/).
- I do some freelance software development work on the side, under the moniker [Binary BBQ](https://binarybbq.com/). I'm currently open to the right circumstances of client work.
- I've completed work on a substantial update of my book, *[Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec)*. This is a free update for anyone who's already bought the book. It's based on RSpec 3.6 and Rails 5.1. It's the last update for awhile.
- I'm interested in giving variations of my recent talk, [The Git Historian](https://speakerdeck.com/ruralocity/the-git-historian), to more audiences. Please give me potential leads!
- I continue to [read a lot](/pages/reading.html). I try to read a bit of a technical book during the day, and a bit of a non-technical book at night.
- I run three times a week. It takes time away from other things I should be doing, but it's worth it.
- I am *not* doing any pro bono work, mentoring, etc. for awhile, though I'm interested in working with rural government data at the moment.
