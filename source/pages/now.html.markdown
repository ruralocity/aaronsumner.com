title: What I'm doing right now
---

This page is inspired by Derek Sivers's [Now Page Movement](http://nownownow.com/about). It's current as of March 23, 2019. If my priorities change, I'll update the page.

- I work full-time as a Senior Software Engineer at [O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/). I work on the backend to software for managing our conferences like OSCON, Strata, Velocity, and others.
- I do some freelance software development work on the side, under the moniker [Binary BBQ](https://binarybbq.com/). I'm open to select clients at this time. Ask me about Rails application security audits and upgrading small-to-medium-sized legacy Rails applications.
- For the first time in awhile, I've been doing coding for fun (though with a bent toward things I need or want to learn). I'll be sharing more in the coming weeks and months.
