title: What I'm doing right now
---

This page is inspired by Derek Sivers's [Now Page Movement](http://nownownow.com/about). It's current as of May 2, 2018. If my priorities change, I'll update the page.

- I work full-time as a Senior Software Engineer at [O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/).
- I do some freelance software development work on the side, under the moniker [Binary BBQ](https://binarybbq.com/). I'm not taking any new clients at this time.
- I spend most of the rest of my time closing out my late grandmother's estate, and moving halfway across the United States to Astoria, Oregon.
- Errata fixes for my book, _[Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec)_, are slow going while I address that previous bullet. Thanks for your understanding.
