I've decided to remove a traditional commenting mechanism from this site, so if you have a question or something to say you'll need to go one of these routes:

- Send me an at-reply on Twitter; I'm [@ruralocity](https://twitter.com/ruralocity) there.
- Send me an email at [aaron@ruralocity.com](mailto:aaron@ruralocity.com).
- If you have a question about something from _Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec_, please direct it to the [GitHub issues page for that project](https://github.com/everydayrails/rspec_rails_4/issues).

I do my best to reply, but please understand that I'm a pretty busy guy and it can sometimes take me a few days.
