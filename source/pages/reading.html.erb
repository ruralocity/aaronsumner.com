title: Reading List

Hey, most of these links point to Amazon.com and include my affiliate code, so if you purchase them I get a small cut. O'Reilly books are an exception since I get to read those for free. All that said, I get most of my reading material from my local public libraryâ€”so be sure to check them out, too.
