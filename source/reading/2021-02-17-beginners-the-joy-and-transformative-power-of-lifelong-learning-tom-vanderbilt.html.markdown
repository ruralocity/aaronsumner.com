Comes off as a little privileged at times, and (maybe) tone deaf in a time
when travel is a really stupid idea (like, maybe don't talk up trips to
Costa Rica to learn surfing, or Greece to learn deep-water swimming), but
overall I appreciated the message. And it's always nice to see the Dreyfus
model of skill acquisition get a shout-out.
