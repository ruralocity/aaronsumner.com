I read this one for a study group at work. It's got some nice ideas, but I suspect they're easier to follow for an academic than those of us who have to keep an eye on Slack while also trying to get things done. That said, it didn't make me angry, like his previous book did. Read it with an open mind and adopt what makes sense.
