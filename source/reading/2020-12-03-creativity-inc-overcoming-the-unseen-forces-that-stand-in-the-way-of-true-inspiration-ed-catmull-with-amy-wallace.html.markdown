I thoroughly enjoyed this book, both for its insider's perspective of several
now-iconic films, and Catmull's takes on creativity and leadership. Lots of
applications outside of what's traditionally thought of as _creative_ work these
days, including software engineering. A little cringeworthy at times--the MeToo
fallout at Pixar happened a couple of years after this book's release--but
otherwise highly recommended.
