Another one of those books that could probably be a decent-sized
post on Medium instead of a whole business book (see also: Malcolm Gladwell).
Most of McKeown's observations and advice should be obvious to most, but
unfortunately, probably, isn't. (Or maybe it's just our inability to say no in
life keeping us from taking his recommended path).
