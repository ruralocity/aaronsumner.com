I've been working on reviving my own technical blog, and wanted to like this book. It's got some good suggestions, but spends too much time on tools and not enough time on writing. Writing's the hard part. And, unfortunately, another title off the Pragmatic Bookshelf with _way_ too many "you should"s. I don't know why that makes me bristle the way it does, but here we are.
