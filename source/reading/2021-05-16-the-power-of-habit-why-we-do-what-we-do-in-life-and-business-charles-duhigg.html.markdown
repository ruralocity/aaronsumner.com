I've enjoyed some of Duhigg's other (subsequent?) work, but this one left me
really disappointed. For one, it's about three times longer than it needs to
be. For another, some of the examples and advice are condescending at best,
toxic at worst. The audiobook version's narrator does not help matters.
Bummer.
