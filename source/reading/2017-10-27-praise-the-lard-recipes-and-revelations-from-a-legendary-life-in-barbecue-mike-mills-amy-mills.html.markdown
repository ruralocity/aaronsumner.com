I'm from the south part of Illinois, a couple of hours from Murphysboro, but I've never been to 17th Street Barbecue. This book didn't make me want to make the extra drive next time I'm visiting the area. I prefer the keep-it-simple approach espoused by Aaron Franklin in [his book](http://amzn.to/2jXjnbe) and [television series](http://amzn.to/2iNb82p) over the recipes here, and the essays in between are too high-and-mighty for me.
