It took me months to actually finish this book. I have mixed feelings about it, as I do with most in this genre. [This Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/gcaprio/status/1128325063923707904) sums up a lot of the book's shortcomings (especially the handwaving over stuff like healthcare in the United States). But I _have_ seen these tactics work in the alternate scenario Jarvis proposes, being a company of one within a larger organization.
