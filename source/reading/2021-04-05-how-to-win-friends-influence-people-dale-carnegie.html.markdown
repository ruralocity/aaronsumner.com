I'm kind of surprised I never read this before. Even though some of the language and references are dated, a lot of the foundations still apply today. What really struck me, though, is how much this book served as a template for the likes of Gladwell and Pink: Hit upon a simple truism, find a way to break it up into a couple dozen chapters, then share example after example to prove a point.
