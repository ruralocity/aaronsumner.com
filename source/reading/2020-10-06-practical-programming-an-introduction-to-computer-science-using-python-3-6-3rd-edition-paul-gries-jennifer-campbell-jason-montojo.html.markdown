I once had a long conversation with a computer science professor, in
which I posited that it'd be possible to teach enough computer science
fundamentals to build a simple web or mobile app to motivated learners.
I was rebuffed--it'd take at least two years of dedicated study, I was
told. And then bootcamps happened. I wish I'd trusted my gut. Anyway,
this book is more approachable than any computer science textbook I've
seen, if still rather dry.
