Adapting Meathead's [ribs recipe](http://amazingribs.com/recipes/porknography/best_BBQ_ribs_ever.html) resulted in some of the best ribs I've ever cooked. Not sure I agree with all of his assertions, but the book has gotten me rethinking some things I've always just assumed about smoking. A little cheesy in some places, but worth checking out.
