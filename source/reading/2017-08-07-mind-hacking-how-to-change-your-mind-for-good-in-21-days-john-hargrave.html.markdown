I listened to this on a whim on a recent long drive. More self-helpy than I expected (I was expecting something more along the lines of [Gina Trapani's book on lifehacks](http://amzn.to/2juX7cg)), but the application of programming concepts to self improvement was kind of neat. That said, I had a little trouble taking the book that seriously, possibly due to the author's background as a prankster, or the tone in which the book is read.
