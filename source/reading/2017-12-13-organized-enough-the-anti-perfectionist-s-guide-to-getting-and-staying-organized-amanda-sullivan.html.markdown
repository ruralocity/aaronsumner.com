A much-needed, realistic response to the Marie Kondos and haughty minimalists of the world. I'm preparing for a big move, and I don't want to take a big mess with me, and I don't want to start a new big mess once I've settled in. Amanda Sullivan's _FLOW_ approach (Forgive yourself, Let it go, Organize what's left, Weed constantly) looks to be a great solution for the chronically cluttered (like me). Recommended.
