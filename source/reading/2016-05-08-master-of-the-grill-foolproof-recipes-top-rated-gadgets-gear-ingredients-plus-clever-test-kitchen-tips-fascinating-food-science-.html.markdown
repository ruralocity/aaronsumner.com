I've read a lot of books on outdoor cooking, but this one is one of the better ones. Recipes progress from basic to advanced, making this a good one for people at all levels. I also like the insight the authors provide into how they arrived at these recipes. Recommended, and looking forward to trying some of these out this summer on my own grill and smoker.
