*Peak* made me reflect on my own learning habits, as well as my attempts to teach others. I'll admit to wondering *what-if* more than once while reading this book--what if I'd taken school more seriously, or been given more of a chance to participate in out-of-school activities? We'll never know, but at least I know I can keep improving myself. Recommended for lifelong learners and the people who aspire to create them.
