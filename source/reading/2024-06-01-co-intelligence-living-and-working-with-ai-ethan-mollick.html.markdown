If you're interested in AI and not sure where to begin, this book is a solid primer on what's possible and what's (maybe) to come. If you've already dismissed AI then _Co-Intelligence_ probably won't change your mind. All that said, by the time you stumble upon this entry in my reading list, AI technology may have advanced past this book, or totally popped as a bubble. In the meantime, recommended.
