I picked up this book to explore alternatives to Jeff Galloway's method
for distance running training, particularly for elements like strength
and flexibility that I think Galloway dismisses too readily. I might
pick up a thing or two from this book, but I suspect it's not a great
plan for beginning runners to just, well, run with.
