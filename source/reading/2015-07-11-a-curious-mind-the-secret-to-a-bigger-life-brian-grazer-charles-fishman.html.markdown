I enjoyed this book. It's a little redundant, as this type of book is, but still an interesting read. I've been thinking about curiosity relative to the [Dreyfus model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) lately--seems to me that curiosity is critical for advancing up the scale. Anyway, worth checking out.
