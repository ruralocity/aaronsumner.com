      <a href="http://everydayrails.com/">Everyday Rails</a> is a blog for
      people who need to build stuff with Rails and get on to their next
      project. Sometimes it's still about Ruby and Rails, though these days I
      tend to think and write about broader topics there.

    <p>
      I'm Aaron Sumner, of Astoria, Oregon, USA;  by way of Lawrence, Kansas,
      Seattle, Washington, and Jersey County, Illinois.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've worked on the web since 1994 when I began creating some of the
      very first departmental and organizational websites as an
      undergraduate at the University of Kansas. Over the years I've
      worked my way through static HTML to Applescript (yes, Applescript)
      to Perl to PHP to Ruby. Since 2005 I've worked mostly with Ruby and
      Rails, with a dose of Javascript and helping of Python. I'm becoming
      more fluent and productive in React right now.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a Senior Software Engineer at
      <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Media</a>.
      Most people who know me know me as a tech author, though; I wrote
      <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec">Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec</a></em>
      and have blogged at <a href="https://everydayrails.com">Everyday Rails</a>
      since 2010.
    </p>

    <p>
      When off the clock and away from the text editor, I like
      outdoor cooking, baseball (go Cards), college sports (Rock Chalk
      Jayhawk), woodworking, and running.
    </p>

    <p>
      I still learn new things every day. Sometimes I share them here.
      Thanks for following along.
