Valleywag's <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/5158190/the-end-of-second-life">report on the state of Second Life</a> is nothing earth-shattering, but my favorite part is the quote toward the end: "Only compared to the life of a university professor might Second Life actually seem exciting." Ouch!
