The mildest winter I can ever remember means flowers are sprouting and
trees are budding in northeast Kansas. Actually, they started a couple
of weeks ago; they’re good and photographable now. See:

I’m no good with tree identification just yet; I keep meaning to pick
something up at the library next time I’m downtown. All I can tell you
that the above buds are on [this tree I photographed last fall in its
autumnal
glory](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockchalk/6341098512/in/photostream).

Yeah, I don’t know what this one is, either. It’s a smaller tree
positioned behind the house.

Some little crocuses are already blooming on the sunny side of the
house.

JoJo the Dog has enjoyed the mild winter. Here he is fresh from an
outside romp&mdash;just tired enough to stop and pose for a photograph.
