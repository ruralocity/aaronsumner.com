I’ve ditched WordPress in favor of
[Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/), a static-site generator
I’ve been having fun with for the past few weeks. What you see here is a
new design I started messing with, with all content rendered by Jekyll.
I’ve got some bugs to work out but should have everything at a happy
place in the next few days. I’m also going to get back on a regular
blogging schedule, starting this week.

In the meantime, comments should be working if you want to let me know
what you think.
