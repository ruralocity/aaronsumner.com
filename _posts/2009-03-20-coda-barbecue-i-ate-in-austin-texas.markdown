To close out my notes from my trip to Austin for South by Southwest
Interactive 2009, I'd like to touch on my other objective for the week:
To sample as much barbecue as possible. I made it to three local
smokehouses (or two smokehouses, and one auxiliary location):

First up: My first meal upon arriving in Austin was at the **Iron
Works**, conveniently located downtown, next to the convention center.
Good beef ribs. Great sausage. Good sides. Good sauce, Good ambiance.
This place had a line out the door every day during the actual
conference.

A few nights later: **Rudy's**, located in a convenience story-type
building somewhere at the south end of town. Best. Brisket. Ever. And
super-friendly service, quick with the samples--I've never *really* had
creamed corn until the other night. Good sauce, too, and an ice-cold
Lone Star washed everything down real nice. In sum: Awesome. This was my
best Texas barbecue experience.

Heading out, I stopped at the **Salt Lick** location at the Austin
airport. Yeah, it was at the airport--and I had it on authority from
locals that you can't tell the difference between this one and the
original, several miles out of town. The brisket and sausage platter I
ordered was nothing to write home about. I'm hoping the airport version
is just a poor representation.

At the end of the day, though, I'll take Bryant's in Kansas City (or
Biemer's or Vermont Street in Lawrence) any day.
