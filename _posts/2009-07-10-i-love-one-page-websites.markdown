Here's a site redesign I put together over the course of a couple of hours
between yesterday and today: A new look for [Stratepedia's hub
site](http://stratepedia.org/). I do this about once a year ([here's
las---for-stratepediaorg.html)).
One page, with a focus on moving people on to the tools they actually
want to use. It's also going to afford more room for growth than the
last one did, in terms of having room to link to major new products and
initiatives. Now it's just a matter of adding another \<div\> to the
grid.

I took the opportunity as an excuse to mess with
[Blueprint](http://blueprintcss.org/) in a productional sense, in part
because the new KU template (which I admittedly seldom use) uses
Blueprint, and because I was curious about how much time I might really
save with it. I probably did save some time with the grid--especially in
the uniform boxes near the center of the page--but it felt kind of
dirty, like I was using tables for layouts.

For larger projects, I may give [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
another look--I do really like Sass, and Haml's growing on me, and I
guess there's nothing saying I *have* to use a CSS framework to use any
of them.
