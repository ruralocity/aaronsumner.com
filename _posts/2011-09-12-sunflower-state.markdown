If you live in Lawrence, and seldom leave town save for an occasional
trip to Kansas City or Topeka via I-70 or K-10, you may sometimes forget
why our state’s nickname is the Sunflower State. Do yourself a favor in
the next few days and head north up US-59/24 (that’s over the bridge;
keep driving north past the Turnpike exchange). You can get to Topeka
that way if you’d like, but you don’t really have to go that
far&mdash;even by turning around at Midland Junction you can get a sense
of the scenery the rest of northeast Kansas gets to see.

Flowers like the ones above grow wild along my street now. Below is a
photo of my nearest “neighbor”&mdash;a working farm with no actual
residents.

Next-closest are the cattle and occasional horse I hear during the day,
and the coyotes I hear at night.
