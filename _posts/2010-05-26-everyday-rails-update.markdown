For those of you who might be interested: I’ve added some more posts to
my nascent [Everyday Rails](http://everydayrails.com/) blog project, the
purpose of which is to share how *I* get things done on a day-to-day
basis with Ruby on Rails. I’m still trying to get comfortable with my
voice on that site, but I’ve added content for:

-   [Using Rails app
    templates](http://everydayrails.com/2010/05/22/bootstrapping-rails-template.html)

-   [Using Nifty Generators to create starter layouts and
    CSS](http://everydayrails.com/2010/05/25/nifty-generators.html)

-   [Creating application-wide variables using Nifty Generators’
    nifty\_config
    generator](http://everydayrails.com/2010/05/27/nifty-config.html)

I’ve also created a [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/everydayrails)
for the project; it will be updated whenever there’s new content. An
[Atom feed](http://everydayrails.com/atom.xml) for the site is working
now, too.
