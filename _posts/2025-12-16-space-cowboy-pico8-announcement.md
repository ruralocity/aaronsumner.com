Hello! I'm happy to share I've released a new Pico-8 game called **Some People Call Him the Space Cowboy**. You can check it out and play for free at [Bandageman Studios](https://bandageman.com/space-cowboy/), or on the [Lexalaffle BBS](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=153452).

I started working on this game last summer. It began with a pixel sketching session, wherein I noodled a little cowboy character. A few minutes later he had a body, and a few minutes after that I decided he should be the Space Cowboy (with a reverent nod in homage to [Steve Miller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV3AziKTBUo&list=RDdV3AziKTBUo&start_radio=1)). The rest evolved from there.

My first draft was pretty buggy. I kept the sprites but otherwise started fresh after watching the fantastic [Lazy Devs Shmup Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P3Sfq4XJqNVbd1vsWnh7LZd). What I'm sharing now is so, so much better than what I had just a few months ago! It's still not perfect, and there are things I still want to add at some point.

But perfect is the enemy of good, as they say, and I felt a strong need to just get this out in the world and let perfect simmer in the back of my brain while I work on other things.

Anyway, it's a **free-as-in-no-really-it's-free** thing that's out in the world and I hope it gives you a few minutes of amusement. Bonus points if it inspires you to put something fun out there, yourself. Go forth and speak of the pompatus of love.

**Some People Call Him the Space Cowboy** is available at [Bandageman Studios](https://bandageman.com/space-cowboy/), or on the [Lexalaffle BBS](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=153452). And have I mentioned it is free.
