It's been awhile since I did a picks post. I used to do them on Fridays, but started feeling scheduling pressures to come up with picks during weeks when, honestly, all I had were anti-picks. I don't feel like giving anti-picks the time of day in this venue, honestly. If you want to know what gets my goat these days just buy me a beer the next time you see me at Johnny's.

Anyway, the picks thing started as a cheap way to try to meet a self-imposed writing quota. I hate quotas, so now I'll just write about my picks when I have enough to write about. Here's what I like right now.

### [You Might Not Need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com)

Yes, this site made the rounds a couple of months ago. Now, I like jQuery. That may not be cool to say these days, but I like it when frameworks save me from dealing with the pain that is cross-browser support (see also: Bootstrap).

Unfortunately, this past week I had to deal explicitly with the issue presented by customers who use the likes of Noscript or Ghostery. Ham-handedly blocking all JavaScript? No problem. Browsers have handled that since the lousy-little-language-that-could's inception. Discerning folks who pick and choose what they want to load? Dammit.

The good news: My ten-line, jQuery-dependent script was converted to a ten-line, pure JavaScript script. I owe it to [You Might Not Need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com). Yeah, this stuff is out there in other places, but it was useful to have it under one roof.

### [Ruby Best Practices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596523015.do)

I've long said that Rick Olsen's *[Eloquent Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321584104/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321584104&linkCode=as2&tag=everrail-20)* is my favorite Ruby book. Now I have two. Not sure how I missed this one over the years, but Greg Brown's *Ruby Best Practices* is a great book about getting the most out of the language. In particular, I like the focus on real-world examples. Definitely worth a read for intermediate and advanced Rubyists alike.

### [Hefner](http://www.hefnet.com)

I don't know a damn thing about Hefner beyond the four albums I've found in used CD bins in Lawrence and Seattle. Still, some 14 years ago I had to buy *[We Love the City](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QVXIHI/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002QVXIHI&linkCode=as2&tag=everrail-20)* based on the album cover alone. How did I know that it would become part of my life soundtrack, circa 2000-2001? My favorites from the album are the title track and "Painting and Kissing," which had just enough creepy coincidences to make my then-twenty-something mind think *these guys knew what I was about to go through and wrote a song about it for me in advance.*

Maybe not. But a solid album and worth checking out, especially if you like that era of British popular music. Hell, I even had *Ding-dong, the witch is dead!* running through my head the day that Thatcher died.
