#### [Copy](https://copy.com?r=i2HP0t)

I'm a fan of Dropbox, but competing service Copy's got a couple of nice things going for it: First, 15 gigabytes of storage, free, out of the box. Second, when someone in a group posts a giant file in a shared folder, it's doesn't ding *your* quota. I'm eager to try this out with others--[sign up from this link](https://copy.com?r=i2HP0t) and we'll both get additional storage space.

#### [Merrell Proterra](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BLQ9JHM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00BLQ9JHM&linkCode=as2&tag=everrail-20)

I've pretty much only bought Merrell shoes for the past six years or so. Bought these last weekend and love them. Lightweight, good traction; great day-to-day shoe. I'm told they're also excellent trail hikers; I plan to put them up to that in a few weeks.

#### Pencils

Plain old wood number two pencils, just like you used in grade school. I rediscovered them this week and found I prefer them to pens. In fact, give me a pencil and a Sharpie and I should be set.
