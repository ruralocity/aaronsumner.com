title: Kristin Hersh on CASH music

tags: [ Music, Publishing ]
---
[Kristin Hersh](http://kristinhersh.cashmusic.org/) is publishing music on <a href="http://cashmusic.org/">CASH Music</a>, a "non-profit-organization dedicated to improving the music experience for artists and listeners alike." Music is released under a Creative Commons license and freely streamable and downloadable in a variety of formats. Donations are accepted. This is a neat idea--I hope it takes off.
