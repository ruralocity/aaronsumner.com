A couple of years ago I threw together a little feed aggregator to collect Kansas Jayhawk-related sports headlines into one place. I used a domain name I'd owned for years, a free WordPress theme, and a couple of WP plugins to slap everything together in less than an hour.

Fast-forward to the very last day of 2014. I'm in the middle of migrating hosting providers, and as part of that I don't want to maintain any more PHP-based sites. In order to keep the site going, I'd have to either find an alternate hosting solution or rewrite it. I chose the latter.

I'd been thinking about a rewrite anyway, if for no other reason than to have more control over the app than I'd get by hacking around on WordPress. In particular, I always wanted the headlines to be more of a daily listing, and not look like a blog. Also, WordPress.

I started messing around with it a couple of weeks ago, and officially switched DNS over a little while ago. [Rock Chalk Nation, the reboot, is live](http://rockchalknation.com)!

It's got a few issues that I already know about, so don't feel like you need to report them:

- I haven't imported old headlines from the WP version yet. This is a separate task that'll hopefully yield content for a future blog post or pamphlet or something.
- It's not very mobile-friendly yet, and I'm sorry if that gets you uptight. I'm using [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) for the first time on this project, and haven't done the work to get responsiveness and all that going.
- For that matter, I have no clue how it looks in IE. I'll try to check someday.

A few things I learned along the way:

- The ads on the old site were ugly and annoying, and to this day I've yet to see a penny from Google ads. So I nixed them.
- RSS may not quite be dead, but from what I've seen during this reboot, it's on its way. I ran into a few feeds that were still advertised, but not actually serving anything. In other cases, a feed's address just changed without warning. (I hope I didn't do the same, but I don't think I did.)

I'm not sure who still looks at the site besides me, as I'm too lazy to dig through the visitor data, but maybe you'll find this useful.
