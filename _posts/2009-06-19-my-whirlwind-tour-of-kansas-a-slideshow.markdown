<p>Last weekend I took a tour of some of the landmarks of Kansas. If you're from here you've probably heard of most of these places, but if your impression of Kansas is that it's just farms, tornados and Toto, you're in for a surprise.
</p>
<p>Here's the complete slideshow, with 70-some photos. Included are photos from Kanopolis (Mushroom Rock State Park); Lucas (Garden of Eden, Deeble House, Grassroots Arts Center); Hays; Oakley (Fick Museum, Monument Rocks) and Colby (Prairie Museum of Art and History).
