title: Recreating The White Album, Every Nine Days

This is neat! <a href="http://everyninedays.wordpress.com/">Every Nine Days</a> is a one-woman attempt to recreate the Beatles' <em>White Album</em> entirely by herself, start to finish, a la <em>Julie &#38; Julia</em> (which I haven't seen). I'm jealous I didn't have this idea, though I might have done <em>Alien Lanes</em> or <em>Zen Arcade</em> instead. But that's just me. Also just me: My attempts would sound extremely horrible by any comparison.
