#### [Downcast](http://www.downcastapp.com)

I've been a Downcast user for a couple of years now--it's the podcatcher app I never knew I needed. Easily subscribe to and sort your favorite podcasts. My favorite feature is the ability to create playlists. Great for anyone with a commute.

#### [Alfred v2](http://www.alfredapp.com)

Downloaded it a few weeks ago, but have only just begun digging into what makes it a substantial upgrade to version 1. There are little things, like making the preferences manager a standalone app. And then there's the slick new workflow system, and gems like [Forecast](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/193-weather-workflow-with-conditions-and-forecast/) and [fast user switching](http://www.zibity.com/othergoodies) and [battery info](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1211-battery-view-summary-stats-about-your-laptop-battery/).

#### [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321721330/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321721330&linkCode=as2&tag=everrail-20)

Started it last fall but got sidelined. Finally getting back into it and love it. A great next book for anyone who's read Russ Olsen's [Eloquent Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321584104/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321584104&linkCode=as2&tag=everrail-20) and/or who wants to tackle object-oriented design from a Ruby frame of mind.
