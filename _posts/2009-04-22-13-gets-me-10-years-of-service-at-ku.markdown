title: 13 gets me 10 (years of service at KU)

tags: [ Work ]
---
Today I got a form letter from Chancellor Bob telling me that my five-year service award will be given to me next month. It's actually taken 13 years due to my six-month stint at KU Med and two-and-a-half years at the University of Washington.

The big takeaway is I've been working at this racket for a long time now. (Like, I remember when you could finally include inline images in web pages and how that was going to be a game changer.) Also, I'm trying to figure out why I never got a five-year award. Would that have come up while I was working for KU from Seattle? And do you think someone still has it sitting in a drawer somewhere?
