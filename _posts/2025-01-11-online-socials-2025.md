Hiya--as you may know, I've more or less been off Twitter/X since about 2016. I've not been active on Facebook for some time, and I'm now getting away from Instagram. Meta and its leader have always grossed me out, and recent policy changes are the last straw for me.

So here's a list of where to find me online these days, and what to expect when you do.


## Sites

- **My personal blog** (this site) will continue to be where I post longer-form items. It's also where I keep a list of what I'm reading/have read since 2014. <https://www.aaronsumner.com/>
- **Everyday Rails** is where I write about code and coding--usually about Ruby on Rails, but increasingly more general purpose topics. <https://everydayrails.com/>

Both have RSS/Atom feeds for your convenience!


## Socials

- **Bluesky** is becoming my front door to the federated socials. I'll share links to articles I've written and whatever else I'm thinking about or creating there. Warning, it may get salty. [@ruralocity@bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/ruralocity.bsky.social)
- I tend to talk about more technical matters on **Mastodon**. Also with the occasional salt. [@ruralocity@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@ruralocity)
- I'm slightly more professional on **LinkedIn**. <https://www.linkedin.com/in/asumner/>
- And I'm setting up a **Pixelfed** presence as I move away from Instagram and Meta. Pics will likely be a mix of the usual--woodworking, cooking, travel, and life back in Saint Louis. <https://pixelfed.org/@ruralocity>


## Code

- I share most of my coding work on **GitHub**. I still like its feature set and integrations more than other options, sorry not sorry. <https://github.com/ruralocity>
- I've got a **Codeberg** account, but I've not shared anything there yet. <https://codeberg.org/ruralocity>
- I'm also on **GitLab**, but usually just to check out their new features vis a vis other hosted Git providers. <https://gitlab.com/ruralocity>


## Creations

- I'm working on setting up shop for my woodworking projects on **Etsy**! Buy something or at least follow me, will ya? More to come as the year progresses. <https://www.etsy.com/shop/LowOverheadWood>
