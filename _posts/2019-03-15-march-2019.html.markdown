I don't want to jinx the next few weeks, but I think we lucked out on our first winter on the Oregon coast. I was prepared for the worst: Non-stop rain, heavy winds, never-ending gray skies. We had all that in stretches, but they were shorter than I'd been expecting. I assume this won't be typical.

In keeping with doing a regular update mid-month, here's what I've been up to lately. No big travel or lost pets these past four weeks, but plenty to cover all the same:

- Over on Everyday Rails, I posited the question, [is it still important to know SQL](https://everydayrails.com/2019/02/18/rails-sql-requirements.html) in a day with powerful ORMs like Active Record? (Spoiler: I thought of seven reasons, and I'm sure there are more.) I've had a part two to this post sitting mostly finished in my drafts folder for almost a month now; with sufficient interest I may build the gumption get it out the door.

- I also spent some time moving this site over to Netlify from a server I've been managing myself. I wish I'd done this years ago! I wrote a [brief post on the migration experience](https://aaronsumner.com/posts/2019/03/netflify-migration.html), and the features I've been digging. I should note I have no affiliation with Netlify; just a happy consumer.

- March 12 was the seven-year anniversary of my first post on Everyday Rails about [how I learned to test Rails applications](https://everydayrails.com/2012/03/12/testing-series-intro.html). The response I got to those initial six posts helped me realize that I may be onto something. I had heard about [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com) as a means for converting blog content into a book, and decided to give it a go. Seven years and more than 6,500 readers later, I'm celebrating this little anniversary by [offering a great deal my book, _Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec_, for just $7](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec/c/7thbirthday). I think that's the lowest public discount I've ever offered. It's good through March, 2019, so grab it while it's hot.

- Finally, I just started experimenting with [cross-posting my technical content to DEV](https://dev.to/ruralocity). I feel better about sharing there than I do some other content sites. If you're active on DEV, I hope you'll give me a follow/heart/unicorn/etc.

Meanwhile, I have a couple of irons in the fire that I'm hoping I'll be able to say more about in the next couple of months. I think It'll be one or the other. There's one thing I can mention:

- I mentioned starting a local civic hacking initiative for Astoria and Clatsop County. I just started a little proof-of-concept project around public data provided by the Oregon Department of Forestry. I'm going to demo at the next [Astoria Full Stack](https://www.meetup.com/Astoria-Full-Stack/events/259493799/) meetup. See you there. It'll be open source on or before that date.
