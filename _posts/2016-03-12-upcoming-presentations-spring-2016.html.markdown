I'm scheduled to make a couple of presentations at area meetups in the next few months:

## Wrapping APIs

A few months back, I did some work with the Slack API to do custom data exports. I'll share my thought process and tools used at [Lawrence Coders](http://www.meetup.com/Lawrence-Coders/events/229142285/) on **Wednesday, March 23**. The tools are in Ruby, but the concepts are general enough that they should apply to most other programming languages.

## Game development in Ruby for fun (not profit) (working title)

Come to [KC Ruby](http://www.meetup.com/kcruby/) in **June** (date to be determined) learn about my foray into Gosu, a Ruby library for creating 2D video games. I'll talk about why I became interested in game development, what I learned, and give everyone a chance to play the <strike>awesome</strike> adequate game I tinkered with in the process. Again, I'll be showing Ruby-specific tools, but don't let that stop you from joining us if you speak other languages.
