This has been a busy, challenging, taxing year, and I haven't taken the time to note any of it here. A quick summary, for anyone interested, in no particular order:

- I moved to [Astoria, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoria,_Oregon), in May, after becoming enamored with it a couple of years ago. A small window of opportunity opened itself up for this move. It wasn't easy, but it's one of those things that may never have happened if I passed it up this time. Along the way I learned that there are professional pet movers who will load up your cats in a minivan and hustle them halfway across the country in a couple of days, that my 20-year-old pickup _can_ make that same distance, across the Rockies, albeit at a slower pace, and that being 20 minutes from the beach is pretty damn neat, as is running most weekends along the Columbia River.

- For the record, I _do_ miss things about Lawrence--including, but not limited to, Johnny's Tavern, Biemer's Barbecue, Horjesi Family Athletics Center, easy access to Saint Louis, the Kansas City Ruby Meetup Group, and Ad Astra Running.

- I've had some personal/family challenges that have consumed a lot of my time and energy. If you know me personally you know what they have been. They're taking longer to resolve than I'd hoped, but we're getting there.

- I was promoted to senior software engineer at [O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com), and hit my five-year anniversary there in July.

- I appeared as a guest on three Ruby-flavored podcasts: [Ruby Rogues episode 353](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-353-removing-business-logic-from-rails-controllers-with-aaron-sumner/), [My Ruby Story episode 58](https://devchat.tv/my-ruby-story/mrs-058-aaron-sumner/), and the [Ruby Testing Podcast episode 3](http://www.rubytestingpodcast.com/aaron-sumner). I don't think I have a voice for podcasts, but I did enjoy the experiences.

- I didn't talk about it publicly, but I started and abandoned a new book idea (my first since my [Rails testing book](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec)). The new idea wasn't working as a book, but may as a video series. We will see. Winter nights are long and rainy here, so I'll have time in the coming months to experiment with ideas.

- Speaking of the book I _did_ write, I pushed out a [larger-than-expected update in August](https://everydayrails.com/2018/08/22/rspec-book-updates-august-2018.html), in spite of my current misgivings about the diminishing returns of evergreen content.

- I'm getting involved with a small [Meetup group of software developers in and around Astoria](https://www.meetup.com/Astoria-Full-Stack/). Last week I reprised my talk _[The Git Historian](https://speakerdeck.com/ruralocity/the-git-historian)_ for the group. It's very small at the moment, but I'm glad that I don't have to drive hours to Portland or Seattle to engage face-to-face with other software professionals.

- I've run in four 5Ks and one 10K since my last post here, with [another 10K coming this Sunday](http://www.greatcolumbiacrossing.com) across [this bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoriaâ€“Megler_Bridge). I'm not any faster (probably slower), but what I lack in speed I make up in persistence. I've got nothing scheduled after Sunday's race, and I'm already feeling anxious about that.

- Seriously, Astoria needs a good running store and more barbecue options. I often say I'm going to do something about the latter, but don't hold me to it. I'm just joking, ok?
