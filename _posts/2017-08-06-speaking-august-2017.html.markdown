I'll be doing short presentations at the Kansas City Ruby User Group and Lawrence Coders this month. I'm showing how I've automated parts of the code review process for a Rails application at both events. The demo is based on posts I've written in Everyday Rails about [using Pronto with Rails](https://everydayrails.com/2015/02/17/pronto-ruby-code-review.html) and [adopting a code review mindset](https://everydayrails.com/2017/01/16/code-review-mindset.html).

## Events

- **KC Ruby:** [Tuesday, August 8](https://www.meetup.com/kcruby/events/242136519/)
- **Lawrence Coders:** [Thursday, August 10](https://www.meetup.com/Lawrence-Coders/events/240936048/)

I hope to see you at one, or both! I'm just a small part of each lineup, after all. And even though my process is for Rails, I'm going to try to extend it to other languages and frameworks for Lawrence Coders.
