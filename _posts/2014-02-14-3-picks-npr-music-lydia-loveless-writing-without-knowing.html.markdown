### [NPR Music app](http://www.npr.org/music/mobile/iphone-music.html)

I joke that I haven't bought any new music since 1994. That's not true, but I haven't bought (much) music since, oh, 2004 or so. At least not music by anyone I didn't already enjoy. I've been getting back into things lately--I resubscribed to *Magnet*, and have also come to realize how nice the NPR Music app is for discovering new music. Stream entire albums before their release, for free. I checked out a few while working in a noisy library yesterday morning (when did libraries get so loud?). A great alternative to commercial music discovery services, especially if you still appreciate the album as a format. Probably also available on Android, or just go to the [NPR Music](http://www.npr.org/music/) site to listen.

### Lydia Loveless

One of the albums I listened to yesterday is Lydia Loveless' forthcoming *[Somewhere Else](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HAWRKVI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HAWRKVI&linkCode=as2&tag=everrail-20)*, due out this coming Tuesday. So bad-ass. For those of you in the Lawrence/Kansas City area, she'll be at the Czar Bar on March 6. It's a school night, but I'm going to do my damnedest to make it.

### ["Writing without Knowing"](http://programming.oreilly.com/2014/02/writing-without-knowing.html)

Without knowing it, O'Reilly's Simon St. Laurent wrote this relatively spot-on summary of the process I took to write my own technical book (that's *[Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec)*, cough cough). Seriously, not being the world's foremost expert in a technology is no reason to not write about it--in fact, your beginner's mind may do you a great service in eventually helping others get up-to-speed. Being interested is the key. Read this, then start writing (or screencasting, or whatever)!
